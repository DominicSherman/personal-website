            <p>I am a software engineer currently working for Hy-Vee on a React-Native mobile app for their online shopping experience. I place a high priority on code quality, and enjoy providing reusable and scalable solutions to complex problems. I have worked with our mobile app since itâ€™s conception in June of 2018, and our team has rapidly adapted to new technologies in order to quickly provide a beautiful, fast, robust app for our customers</p>
